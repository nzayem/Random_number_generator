# Random number generator with unique digits from 0 to 9

This is a simple pseudo random code generator with unique digits and without leading zero.

Originally, made this for bulls and cows game project in JetBrains Academy

Simply enter the desired length and the code should generate a random number with unique digits using Math.random().

Length should not exceed 10, obviously.
